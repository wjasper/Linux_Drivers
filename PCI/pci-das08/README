Building and installing the driver:
-----------------------------------

1. Untar the tar file:

   tar zxvf PCI-DAS08-2.10.tgz

2. This should create the following files:

License
Makefile
ModList
README
a2dc.c
a2dc_2_4.c
a2dc_2_6.c
a2dc_2_6.29.c
a2dc_3_3.7.c
a2dc_3_10.11.c
a2dc.h
pci-das08.h
test-das08.c
pci-das08.pdf
RegMapPCI-DAS08.pdf


3. The default configuration is for the kernel to dynamically set the
   major number.  If you wish to override this option and force a particular
   major number, set the following in a2dc.h

   #define DEFAULT_MAJOR_DEV  0    /* Default Major Device Number */

   If you have more than one PCI-DAS08 board in your computer, edit NUM_BOARDS and set
   it to the correct value in the Makefile.

        NUM_BOARDS=2


4. To compile, type:

   make

5. To install the driver type:

    make install

Note:   The driver tries to install itself in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char
        Edit MODULE_DIR in the Makefile to install the driver in another directory.

6. Copy the file 61-mcc.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d,
   (or 60-mcc.rules for the older 2.6 kernel).

   or inlcude the following rule:

#Enable non-root access to pci devices
SUBSYSTEM=="das08",      KERNEL=="ad[0-9]_[0-7]", NAME="das08/%k",      MODE="666"

To test your updated rules you can do one of the following:
1.    /sbin/udevadm control --reload  (or something similar.  type man udevadm)
2.    Reboot your system

You will be able to search the attributes of the device by
   /sbin/udevadm info -a -p $(/sbin/udevadm info -q path -n /dev/das08/ad0_0)


7. To install the driver type:

    make install

8. To test run the test program 'adcread':

    test-das08

Having the driver install at boot:   (2.4 kernel only)
----------------------------------

To install the driver so that it comes up every time on boot-up, you
will need to include the following lines in one of your boot rc files.
The one we used is called /etc/rc.d/rc.local. Your setup may vary.

#! /bin/sh
#
# rc.local	This does local customization.
#
# Author:	Warren Jasper <wjasper@ncsu.edu>
#

echo -n "Local customization:"

if [ -x /sbin/insmod -a -r /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/pci-das08.o ]; then
        echo -n " PCI-DAS08"
        /sbin/insmod  /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/pci-das08.o
fi

How the driver works:
---------------------

The driver is fairly straight forward, but since the current version of
Linux is not 1003.4 compliant (it is not a real-time operating system),
certain design decisions were made in writing this driver. 

Each A/D channel has their own minor number.  I call these virtual
channels or just channels.  There are 16 virtual A/D channels.  The
board has 7 physical A/D channels. When a channel is opened, it is
mapped 1 to 1 to it's physical channel with a gain of +/- 5V.
Therefore, opening /dev/das08/ad0_0 will allow you to read from
physical channel 0 on board 0.  Examples are:

/dev/das08/ad0_0      A/D channel board 0  physical channel 0

These device nodes are generated automagically for you by /sysfs and udev.
Type ls -l /dev/das08 to see all the devices.

After the device is opened, it is possible to map or remap different
physical channels to your virtual channel.  For example, if you want
to read from all 16 channels at once, you will need to map the beginning and
ending physical channel with ioctl calls (see below).  

Each channel can be opened in one of two modes:

#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

...

  int fd;
  fd = open("/dev/pci-das08/ad0_0", Mode);

...


Where Mode is an integer and equal to:

ADC_SOFT_TRIGGER       -- software trigger (one shot)
ADC_EXTERNAL_PACER     -- external pacer on interrupt pin 24.
                          (code not yet implemented)

Please read the limited documentation with the board if you are not
familiar with the different ways to trigger an A/D conversion.

****************************************************************************
NOTE:  You can only open one channel at a time.  If you are running
multiple processes, you must make sure you close the file descriptor before
tying to open it again.
****************************************************************************

To read from a channel, use:

  int bytesRead;             /* number of bytes read */
  int count = 2;             /* desired number of conversions */
  unsigned short data[2048]  /* buffer for data */

  bytesRead = read(fd, data, count);


****************************************************************************
Warning: read() is implemented as a blocking function.  It will return
when "count" conversions are completed.  Since there is only one A/D
chip on the board, conversions are multiplexed anyway.
****************************************************************************

The following ioctl() functions have been implemented:



1. ioctl(fd, COUNTER0, CTR0_MODE2 | 10) ;
   ioctl(fd, COUNTER1, CTR0_MODE2 | 10) ;
   ioctl(fd, COUNTER2, CTR0_MODE2 | 10) ;
   This call programs and sets the control register and the counter register
   of the 8254 COUNTER 0.  You really need to get the documentation on
   the 82C54 Programmable Timer from Intel if you want to program the
   timer. The data argument is packed as follows:

       Value for Counter 0  XXXX    Mode    MSB     LSB
                            Byte 3  Byte 2  Byte 1  Byte 0

   Where Mode is one of the five programmable modes, and Byte 0 and Byte 1
   contain the data value for the 16 bit Counter 0.  In the above example,
   counter0 is set to Mode 2, and the value 10 is loaded into the timer.
   See header file adc.h for more information.

2. ioctl(fd, ADC_GET_STATUS, *value);
    Returns the value of the Status Register, base1+2.


3. ioctl(fd, ADC_GET_DIO, *value);
     Return bits 4-6 base+2 of the digital input lines, pins 25-27.

4. ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_DIO, value);
     Sets bits 4-7 base+2 (OP1-OP4) - OP4) of the digital output lines on the 37 pin
     connector, pins 7-10

5. ioctl(fd, INT_SELECT, value);
     Selects the input to the interrupt.
     value = INTERRUPT_PIN24  // interrupt triggered by pin 24
           = COUNTER2_OUTPUT  // interrupt triggered by couter 2 output

6. ioctl(fd, INT_ENABLE, value);
     Enable or disable interrupts
     value = INTERRUPT_ENABLE  // enable interrupts
           = INTERRUPT_DISABLE // disable interrupts
