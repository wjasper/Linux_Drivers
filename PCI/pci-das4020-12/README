                      ---------------------------

 Linux loadable module for the Computer Boards PCI-DAS 4020/12 Analog & Digital I/O Board
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:
-------------
This driver was written by Warren J. Jasper at North Carolina State
University.  It is a driver for the Measurement Computing PCI-DAS 4020/12 A/D
adapter. It should run on all Linux 2.4, 2.6 and 3.X kernels on Pentium machines.
With minor modification, it should run on other architectures.

I would like to acknowledge the help and assistance of Eric Blossom.
Parts of this driver are based off of his code that can be found at
http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio.

Please send comments and bug fixes to wjasper@ncsu.edu.  The source
for the driver is located at https://github.com/wjasper/Linux_Drivers

Building and installing the driver:
-----------------------------------

1. Untar the tar file:

   tar zxvf PCI-DAS4020-12.1.25.tgz

2. This should create the following files:

License
a2dc.c
a2dc_2_4.c
a2dc_2_6_20.c
a2dc_2_6_26.c
a2dc_2_6_29.c

3. The default configuration is for the kernel to dynamically set the
   major number.  If you wish to override this option and force a particular
   major number, set the following in a2dc.h

   #define DEFAULT_MAJOR_DEV  0    /* Default Major Device Number */
 

4. To compile, type:

   make

5. To install the driver type:

    make install

6. Copy the file 61-mcc.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d,
   (or 60-mcc.rules for the older 2.6 kernel).

   or inlcude the following rules:

#Enable non-root access to pci devices
SUBSYSTEM=="das4020-12", KERNEL=="ad[0-9]_[0-4]", NAME="das4020-12/%k", MODE="666"
SUBSYSTEM=="das4020-12", KERNEL=="da[0-9]_[0-1]", NAME="das4020-12/%k", MODE="666"
SUBSYSTEM=="das4020-12", KERNEL=="dio[0-9]_*",    NAME="das4020-12/%k", MODE="666"

To test your updated rules you can do one of the following:
1.    /sbin/udevadm control --reload  (or something similar.  type man udevadm)
2.    Reboot your system

You will be able to search the attributes of the device by
   /sbin/udevadm info -a -p $(/sbin/udevadm info -q path -n /dev/das4020-12/dio0_0A)


7. To test run the test program 'test-das4020'

    ./test-das4020


Having the driver install at boot: (2.4 kernel only)
----------------------------------

There are 2 ways you can do this:

1) add the following line to your /etc/modules.conf

        alias char-major-250 pci-das4020-12

2) To install the driver so that it comes up every time on boot-up, you
   will need to include the following lines in one of your boot rc files.
   The one we used is called /etc/rc.d/rc.local. Your setup may vary.

#! /bin/sh
#
# rc.local	This does local customization.
#
# Author:	Warren Jasper <wjasper@ncsu.edu>
#
echo -n "Local customization:"

if [ -x /sbin/insmod -a -r /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/das4020-12.ko ]; then
        echo -n "PCI-DAS4020/12"
        /sbin/insmod -f /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/das4020-12.ko
fi

****************************************************************************
IMPORTANT:  The driver works in one of 2 modes (see below).  
One of the modes is ADC_DMA_CONVERSION.  This driver supports chained dma and
also maps the dma buffer into local user space with an mmap call. To use this
mode, some things have to be set up correctly at boot time.

Some background about dma usage.  Before data from a slave board can
be transferred to main memory, a dma buffer needs to be set up.  This
is sort of special memory, since the kernel must not cache or swap it.
Some drivers (See Eric Blossom's mc4020.c driver) set up a link list
of kernel pages allocated with get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL), and use
scatter-gather-dma.  The only problem with this is one is not
guaranteed that there will be enough free pages at run time.

I have chosen a slightly different approach.  Since loadable modules
can not allocate kernel memory at load time (exclusively) , 
I try to reserve memory at load time using pci_alloc_consistent() and
a nopage vma method.

Then edit ADC_BUFF_PHY_SIZE accordingly in a2dc.h, to set the DMA
Buffer Size FOR EACH BOARD.  A call to mmap (see example in
test-das4020.c) will map this memory into user space, avoiding the
need to copy data from kernel space into user space!

One should only use dma for large acquisitions at very high speeds.
For smaller sample counts (less than 100), it turns out the polling is
probably more efficient.

Sample rate
   The sample rate is calculated as follows:
  sampleRate = (ADC_PACER_FREQ_VALUE/40 MHz) with the restriction that:
     ADC_PACER_FREQ_VALUE <= 20MHz for 1 or 2 channels
     ADC_PACER_FREQ_VALUE <= 10MHz for 3 or 4 channels

thus the maximum sampling frequency for the board is 20 MHz for 2 channels.

How the driver works:
---------------------

The driver is fairly straight forward, but since the current version of
Linux is not 1003.4 compliant (it is not a real-time operating system),
certain design decisions were made in writing this driver.

Each A/D channel and  D/A channel and DIO  have their own minor number.
I call these virtual channels or just channels.  There are 4 virtual A/D channels.
The board has 4 physical A/D channels. When a channel is opened, it is mapped 1 to 1 to
it's physical channel with a gain of +/- 5V.  Therefore, opening /dev/das4020-12/ad0_0
will allow you to read from physical channel 0 on board 0. 
Examples are:

/dev/das4020-12/ad0_0      A/D channel board 0  physical channel 0
/dev/das4020-12/da2_1      D/A channel board 2  physical channel 1
/dev/das4020-12/dio1_0A    DIO         board 1  port A


These device nodes are generated automagically for you by /sysfs and udev.
Type ls -l /dev/das4020-12 to see all the devices.

After the device is opened, it is possible to map or remap different
physical channels to your virtual channel.  For example, if you want
to read from all 4 channels at once, you will need to map the beginning and
ending physical channel with ioctl calls (see below).  There are also many 
triggering and gain options possible.


Each ADC channel can be opened in one of two modes:

#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

...

  int fd;
  fd = open("/dev/das4020/ad0_0", Mode);

...

Where Mode (Pacer Source) is an integer and equal to:

(for A/D)
ADC_SOFT_CONVERSION          -- software pacer (polled one shot)
ADC_DMA_CONVERSION           -- uses dma/mmap

(Note: Not all triggering modes have been implemented!)

****************************************************************************
NOTE:  You can only open one channel at a time, meaning that channel 0 can 
only be open by one process.  Of course another process can open channel 2.  
If you are running multiple processes, you must make sure you close the 
file descriptor before tying to open it again.
****************************************************************************

To read from a channel, use:

  int bytesRead;             /* number of bytes read */
  int count = 2;             /* desired number of conversions */
  unsigned short data[2048]  /* buffer for data */

  bytesRead = read(fd, data, count);

****************************************************************************
Warning: read() is implemented as a blocking function.  It will return
when "count" conversions are completed.  
****************************************************************************

Non-blocking read has recently been implemented (DMA only) with the
O_NONBLOCK flag. Use read(...) once to initate a request (will always
return error EAGAIN). Then you can use poll()/select() to wait until
the transfer finishes and use read(...) a second time to complete the
request. You could also busyloop on read(...) until it stops returning
EAGAIN. You should pass the same sample count to read() when you call
it to obtain the data, as you did when you called it the first time to
initiate the request. You can use ADC_NBIO_CANCEL, ADC_NBIO_PENDING, and
ADC_NBIO_COMPLETE to help manage pending non-blocking i/o.


The following ioctl() functions have been implemented:

1.  ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_GAINS, Gain); 
    This sets the input gain settings.  There are 10 allowable settings:
    BP_5_00V      //  +/-  5V  for all 4 channels
    BP_1_00V      //  +/-  1V  for all 4 channels

    BP_CH0_5V	 // channel 0 range: +/- 5V
    BP_CH0_1V	 // channel 0 range: +/- 1V

    BP_CH1_5V	 // channel 1 range: +/- 5V
    BP_CH1_1V	 // channel 1 range: +/- 1V

    BP_CH2_5V	 // channel 2 range: +/- 5V
    BP_CH2_1V	 // channel 2 range: +/- 1V

    BP_CH3_5V	 // channel 3 range: +/- 5V
    BP_CH3_1V	 // channel 3 range: +/- 1V

   eg.  ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_GAINS, BP_CH0_5V | BP_CH1_1V | BP_CH2_5V | BP_CH3_1V); 


    See header file pic-das4020.h for more information.

2.  ioctl(fd, ADC_GET_GAINS, Gain); 
    Returns gain setting for that channel.  See header file pci-das4020.h 
    for more information.

3.  ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_PACER_FREQ, frequency);
    Pass the value of the pacer frequency (sample rate) in Hertz.  Should be a number
    between 1k Hz and 20 MHz.  Not all values are possible, but the driver will
    choose the closest possible one.

4.  ioctl(fd, ADC_GET_PACER_FREQ, &frequency);
    Gets the actual pacer frequency in Hz.

5.  ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_TRIGGER, value);
    Set trigger source.  Valid values are:

    DISABLE
    SOFT_TRIGGER     --  In this mode, a software trigger source is used as the starting trigger.  Whan the
                         DAQ Start Register is written to a TRIG1 strobe is generated.
    EXTERNAL_TRIGGER --  In this mode, an external TRIG1 source is used as the starting trigger.  The
                         XTRIX_SRC bit in the DAQ ATRIGLOW register defines the actual external XTRIG1
                         source to be used.
    ANALOG_TRIGGER   --  In this mode, the Analog Trigger source is used as the starting trigger.  The
                         ATRIGSRC bits in the DAQ Control Register 1 are used to select one of the four
                         analog channels as the analog trigger source.  The ATRIGMD bits in the DAQ
                         Control 1 Register select the trigger typed desired.  The DAQATRIG LOW/HIGH
                         registers are used to select the analog trigger level.

6.  ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_GATE, value);
    Set gate source.  Valid values are:
    DISABLE
    EXTERNAL_GATE
    ANALOG_GATE

7.  ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_CHAN_LOW, value);

    begin conversion on this channel.

8.  ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_CHAN_HIGH, value);
    Set the high channel value in 2 channel mode.  This forces the A/D to
    convert from low_chan to high_chan;

9.  ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_ATRIG_LOW, value);
    Set the ADC analog tirgger value low registers.  See documentation on the DAS4020 
    for the proper values.

                           the analog trigger should be programmed to the inactive state to clear out the 
                           trigger circuitry.
    POSITIVE_HYSTERESIS -- The trigger is generated when the signal value is greater than the high-value,
                           with hysteresis specified by low_value.
