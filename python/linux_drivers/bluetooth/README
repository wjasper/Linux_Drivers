This file will hopefully guide you on using the bluetooth package
that will interface to Measurement Computing data acquisition devices.
You will need to do pairing manually (once), for example using a applet like
Blueman.  Once pairing is done, the test program will either do
discovery, or the user can supply the baddr as an optional argument.


To connect to  the device:
./test-bth1208LS                         or
./test-bth1208LS XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

where XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is the bluetooth address, for example: 00:06:71:50:E3

To compile the library, you need to add the bluez-libs-devel package.

On Fedora 22:                sudo dnf install bluez-libs-devel bluez-tools
On Raspian/Ubuntu/Debian:    sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev bluez-tools
Other distributions:         You are on your own ....

To run python scipts:
sudo apt-get install bluez python-bluez
sudo pip3 install pybluez

The package assumes you have the bluez stack installed on your
computer.  This should be standard on most versions of Linux.  You
also need the program bt-device which is usually found in
/usr/bin/bt-device.

Now you are ready to compile and install the library.

cd ~/Linux_Drivers/Bluetooth/c
make
sudo make install
./test-bth1208LS
