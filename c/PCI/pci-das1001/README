                      PCI-DAS1001 Version 1.9   
                      ---------------------------

 Linux loadable module for the Computer Boards PCI-DAS 1001 A/D D/A DIO adapter
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:
-------------
This driver was written by Warren J. Jasper at North Carolina State
University.  It is a driver for the ComputerBoards PCI-DAS 1001 A/D
adapter. It should run on all Linux 2.4, 2.6 and 3.X kernels on
Pentium machines.  With minor modification, it should run on other
architectures.

Please send comments and bug fixes to wjasper@ncsu.edu.  The source
for the driver is located at https://github.com/wjasper/Linux_Drivers

Building and installing the driver:
-----------------------------------

1. Untar the tar file:

   tar zxvf PCI-DAS1001.1.9.tgz

2. This should create the following files:

a2dc_2_4.c
a2dc_2_6.c
a2dc_2_6_29.c
a2dc_3_3_7.c
a2dc_3_10_11.c
AD7376_0.pdf
Makefile

dac8800.pdf   
pci-das1001.h  
test-das1001.c
a2dc.h      
License
README

3. The default configuration is for the kernel to dynamically set the
   major number.  If you wish to override this option and force a particular
   major number, set the following in a2dc.h

   #define DEFAULT_MAJOR_DEV  0    /* Default Major Device Number */

   If you have more than one PCI-DAS1001 board in your computer, edit NUM_BOARDS and set
   it to the correct value in the Makefile.

        NUM_BOARDS=2

4. To compile, type:

   make

5. To install the driver type:

    make install

Note:   The driver tries to install itself in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char
        Edit MODULE_DIR in the Makefile to install the driver in another directory.

6. Copy the file 61-mcc.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d,
   (or 60-mcc.rules for the older 2.6 kernel).

   or inlcude the following rules:

#Enable non-root access to pci devices
SUBSYSTEM=="das1001", KERNEL=="ad[0-5]_*",     NAME="das1001/%k", MODE="666"
SUBSYSTEM=="das1001", KERNEL=="da[0-5]_[0-1]", NAME="das1001/%k", MODE="666"
SUBSYSTEM=="das1001", KERNEL=="dio[0-5]_*",    NAME="das1001/%k", MODE="666"

To test your updated rules you can do one of the following:
1.    /sbin/udevadm control --reload  (or something similar.  type man udevadm)
2.    Reboot your system

You will be able to search the attributes of the device by
   /sbin/udevadm info -a -p $(/sbin/udevadm info -q path -n /dev/das1001/dio0_0A)


7. To test run the test program 'test-das1001'

    test-das1001

Having the driver install at boot:   (2.4 kernel only)
----------------------------------

There are 2 ways to install the driver so that it comes up every time on boot-up. 

1) add the following line to your /etc/modules.conf

   alias char-major-251 pci-das1001

2) You will need to do include the following lines in one of your boot rc
   files.  The one we used is called /etc/rc.d/rc.local. Your setup may
   vary.

#! /bin/sh
#
# rc.local	This does local customization.
#
# Author:	Warren Jasper <wjasper@ncsu.edu>
#
echo -n "Local customization:"


if [ -x /sbin/insmod -a -r /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/pci-das1001.o ]; then
        echo -n "PCI-DAS1001"
        /sbin/insmod -f /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/pci-das1001.o
fi


How the driver works:
---------------------

(This is still under construction.  May not be correct)

The driver is fairly straight forward, but since the current version of
Linux is not 1003.4 compliant (it is not a real-time operating system),
certain design decisions were made in writing this driver.

Each A/D channel and  D/A channel and DIO  have their own minor number.
I call these virtual channels or just channels.  There are 16 virtual A/D channels.
The board has 16 physical A/D channels. When a channel is opened, it is mapped 1 to 1 to
it's physical channel with a gain of +/- 5V.  Therefore, opening /dev/das1001/ad0_0
will allow you to read from physical channel 0 on board 0. 
Examples are:

/dev/das1001/ad0_0      A/D channel board 0  physical channel 0
/dev/das1001/da2_1      D/A channel board 2  physical channel 1
/dev/das1001/dio1_0A    DIO         board 1  port A

These device nodes are generated automagically for you by /sysfs and udev.
Type ls -l /dev/das1001 to see all the devices.

After the device is opened, it is possible to map or remap different
physical channels to your virtual channel.  For example, if you want
to read from all 16 channels at once, you will need to map the beginning and
ending physical channel with ioctl calls (see below).  There are also many 
triggering and gain options possible.

Each channel can be opened in one of two modes:

#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

...

  int fd;
  fd = open("/dev/das1001/ad0_0", Mode);
                              ^------------------------ virtual channel number
                            |__________________________ board number
...


Where Mode (Pacer Source) is an integer and equal to:

(for A/D)
ADC_SOFT_CONVERT             -- software pacer (one shot)
ADC_PACER_CLOCK              -- internal pacer clock with interrupts.


NOTE:  Each device has a pair of (hex) numbers at the end.  The first number refers to the
       board number.  For example, Board 0 is the first PCI-DAS1001 board, Board 1 is the second
       board, etc.  When the PCI BIOS is probing the boards, they are in the order of the slots.

       The second number is the channel number.  When the device is
       open, the virtual channel number is mapped to the physical channel 
       number.  For example

       fd = open("/dev/das1001/ad0_0", ADC_SOFT_CONVERT)

       the fd would refer to physical channel 0.
       However, after the device is open, you can map any contigous range of physical
       channels to a virtual channel.  For example, if you wanted to sample on
       physical A/D channels 0-3:

       ioctl(fd, SET_MUX_HIGH, 3);

       (See the section on ioctl call below.
    

Please read the limited documentation with the board if you are not
familiar with the different ways to trigger an A/D conversion. (There are
a bunch of them).


****************************************************************************
NOTE:  You can only open one channel at a time.  If you are running
multiple processes, you must make sure you close the file descriptor before
tying to open it again.
****************************************************************************

To read from a channel, use:

  int bytesRead;             /* number of bytes read */
  int count = 2;             /* desired number of conversions */
  unsigned short data[2048]  /* buffer for data */

  bytesRead = read( fd, data, count);


****************************************************************************
Warning: read() is implemented as a blocking function.  It will return
when "count" conversions are completed.  Since there is only one A/D
chip on the board, conversions are multiplexed anyway.
****************************************************************************

The following ioctl() functions have been implemented:

1. ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_GAINS, Gain); 
   This sets the input gain settings.  There are 8 allowable settings.
   See header file pic-das1001.h for more information.

2. ioctl(fd, ADC_GET_GAINS, Gain); 
   Returns gain setting for that channel.  See header file pci-das1001.h 
   for more information.

3. ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_PACER_FREQ, frequency);
   Pass the value of the pacer frequency in Hertz.  Should be a number
   between 1 and 200000.  Not all values are possible, but the driver will
   choose the closest possible one.

4. ioctl(fd, ADC_GET_PACER_FREQ, &frequency);
   Gets the actual pacer frequency.

5. ioctl(fd, ADC_START_PACER, 0);
   Starts the pacer clock.

6. ioctl(fd, ADC_STOP_PACER, 0);
   Stops the pacer clock.  Does not change any values.

7. ioctl(fd, COUNTER0, CTR0_MODE2 | 10) ;
   This call programs and sets the control register and the counter register
   of the 8254 COUNTER 0.  You really need to get the documentation on
   the 82C54 Programmable Timer from Intel if you want to program the
   timer. The data argument is packed as follows:

       Value for Counter 0  XXXX    Mode    MSB     LSB
                            Byte 3  Byte 2  Byte 1  Byte 0

   Where Mode is one of the five programmable modes, and Byte 0 and Byte 1
   contain the data value for the 16 bit Counter 0.  In the above example,
   counter0 is set to Mode 2, and the value 10 is loaded into the timer.
   See header file pci-das1001.h for more information.

8. ioctl(fd, ADC_DIO_PRESET, value);
   Sometimes, it is useful to set some digital bits just before a read.
   Since there may be some latency between a call to the dio followed
   by a read, the call stores the desired output bit pattern.  Just
   before interrupts are enabled, the dio is set (lower 4 bits of value).
   (Not currently implemented :(

9. ioctl(fd, ADC_TRIGGER_SOURCE, value);
   Load the value of Trigger Control/Status Register (BADR1+4).  See the file
   pci-das1001.h for possible values.

10. ioctl(fd, SET_MUX_LOW, value);
    Set the beginning value of in the MUX scan register.  This forces the A/D to
    begin conversion on this channel.

11. ioctl(fd, SET_MUX_HIGH, value);
    Set the ending value of in the MUX scan register.  This forces the A/D to
    convert from low_chan to high_chan;

12. ioctl(fd, ADC_GET_CHAN_MUX_REG, *value);
    Return the value of the MUX scan limit register, BADR1 + 2.

13. ioctl(fd, ADC_SET_FRONT_END, True/False);
    Sets board in Differential or Single Ended Mode.
    1 = Single Ended Mode. Supports up to 16 Channels.
    0 = Differential Mode. Supports up to  8 Channels.

14. ioctl(fd, ADC_BURST_MODE, True/False);
    True = Enable Burst Mode
    Channel-to-channel skew is the result of multiplexing the A/D inputs
    and is defined as the time between consecutive samples.  For examle,
    if four channels are sampled at a rate of 1 KHz per channel, the
    channel skew is 250 us ( 1 ms / 4).  Burst mode minimized channel-to-
    channel skew by clocking the A/D at the maximum rate between successive
    channels.  For example, at the 1-ms pulse channel 0 is sampled, channel 1
    is sampled 5 us later, channel 2, 5 us after that and so on.  Then
    no samples are taken until the next 1 ms pulse, when channel 0 is
    sampled again.  In this mode the rate for all channels is 1 KHz, but
    the channel-to-channel skew (delay) is not 5 us, or 20 us total.  The
    minimum burst mode skew/delay on the PCI-DAS1001 is 6 us.

15. ioctl(fd, ADC_PRETRIG, PretirgCount)
    Set up the board for pre-triggering.  PretrigCount must be less than
     32768 and also less than TotalCount - 512.

16. ioctl(fd, NBIO_CANCEL, 0)
    Cancel non-blocking semaphore, clear non-block flag.

17. ioctl(fd, NBIO_PENDIG, &value)
    value = 1 Check to see if read is pending in non-blocking mode.
    value = 0 No read is pending in non-blocking mode.

18. ioctl(fd, NBIO_COMPLETE, &value)
       value = 1  Non-blocking read is complete.  
       value = 0  Non-blocking read is not complete.  

19. ioctl(fd, DIO_SET_MODE, Mode);
   Sets the INTEL 8255 Programmable Peripheral Interface to one of three modes:
       MODE_IO            - normal input/output mode
       MODE_STROBE_IO     - Strobed Input/Output (port A or B)
       MODE_BIDIRECTIONAL - Bi-Directional Bus (port A only )
    See the documentation of the chip for more information

20. ioctl(fd, DIO_SET_DIRECTION, Direction)
   Set the direction of the port to either input or output.  Port C can be split
   into two levels (4 bits each), while ports A and B are either all input or
   all output.

21. ioctl(fd, DAC_SET_GAINS, gain);
    Possible DAC gain settings are:
    BP_10_00V           +/- 10V
    BP_5_00V            +/-  5V 
    UP_10_00V           0 - 10V
    UP_5_00V            0 -  5V

22. ioctl(fd, DAC_GET_GAINS, gain);
    Returs the value of the current gain.  See pci-das1001.h for meaning of the
    values.

23. ioctl(fd, DAC_MODE, arg)
      arg = 0 DACn updated with data written to DACn register
      arg = 1 Both DAC0 and DAC1 updated with data written to DAC0 register

24. ioctl(fd, GET_BUF_SIZE, &value);
    get MAX_COUNT, the maximum number of samples you can
    take in one read().  This is the size of the
    internal buffers in the driver.
