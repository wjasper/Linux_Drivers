 Linux loadable module for the Measurement Computing PCI-QUAD04 Encoder Board
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:        kernel 2.3.30  driver is called:  LS7266R1_2_6_30.c
             kernel 3.3.7   driver is called:  LS7266R1_3_3_7.c
             kernel 3.10.11 driver is called:  LS7266R1_3_10_11.c

Introduction:
-------------
This driver was written by Warren J. Jasper at North Carolina State
University (wjasper@ncsu.edu).  It is a driver for the
Measurement Computing PCI-QUAD04 Quadrature Encoder Input Board.

Please send comments and bug fixes to wjasper@ncsu.edu.  The source for the
driver is located at https://github.com/wjasper/Linux_Drivers

Building and installing the driver:
-----------------------------------

1. Untar the tar file:

   tar zxvf PCI-QUAD04.1.3.tgz

2. This should create the following files:

LS7266R1.c
LS7266R1_2_6_30.c
LS7266R1_3_3_7.c
LS7266R1_3_10_11.c
quad04.h
pci-quad04.h
test-quad04.c
License
Makefile
README
ModList

3. The default configuration is for the kernel to dynamically set the
   major number.  If you wish to override this option and force a particular
   major number, set the following in quad04.h

   #define DEFAULT_MAJOR_DEV  0    /* Default Major Device Number */

4. If you have more than one board on your system, edit
       MAX_BOARDS=1

5. To compile, type:

   make

  To install the driver type:

  make install

6. Copy the file 61-mcc.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d,
   (or 60-mcc.rules for the older 2.6 kernel).

   or inlcude the following rule:

#Enable non-root access to pci devices
SUBSYSTEM=="quad04",      KERNEL=="channel[0-9]_*",    NAME="quad04/%k",      MODE="666"

To test your updated rules you can run:

To test your updated rules you can do one of the following:
1.    /sbin/udevadm control --reload  (or something similar.  type man udevadm)
2.    Reboot your system

You will be able to search the attributes of the device by
   /sbin/udevadm info -a -p $(/sbin/udevadm info -q path -n /dev/quad04/channel0_0)


7. To install the driver type:

    make install

8. To test run the test program "test-ctr05":

    test-ctr05

How the driver works:
---------------------

The driver is fairly straight forward, but since the current version of
Linux is not 1003.4 compliant (it is not a real-time operating system),
certain design decisions were made in writing this driver. 

The PCI-QUAD04 is based on the LS7266R1 24-bit dual-axis quadrature counter.
Please refer to the documentation on the Register Map and the Data Sheet for
the LS7266R1 provided.

Each minor number corresponds to a given counter.  There are four (4)
counters on the quad04 (2 for each LS7266R1) , so minor number 0
corresponds to counter 1, minor number 1 to counter 2 etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
| X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | B2 | B1 | B0 | X | C1 | C0 |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The minor number is made up as follows:

Bits 4-6 (B2-B0) comprise the board number (up to 8 boards on the PCI bus)
Bits 0-3 (C0-C1) comprise the counter number

The devices are made in /dev.  For example:

/dev/quad04/channel0_1
                   ^ ^
                   | |___________  channel number (0-3)
                   |______________ board number (0-7)


To open the channel:

#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

...

  int fd;
  fd = open("/dev/pci-quad04/channel0_1", O_RDWR);

--


The following ioctl() functions have been implemented:
1.  ioctl(fd, LOAD_CMD_REG, command);
    Loads the 8 bit value into the Command Register of the LS7266R1.
    command is an 8-bit value.  See pci-quad04.h

2.  ioctl(fd, GET_CMD_REG, &flag);
    Reads the flag regester for the counter on the LS7266R1.
    FLAG is an 8-bit value.  See pci-quad04.h

3. ioctl(fd, LOAD_IRCR_REG, reg);
   Loads the Interrupt Routing and Control Register.
   See pci-quad04.h.

4. ioctl(fd, GET_IRCR_REG, &reg);
   Reads the Interrupt Routing and Control Register.

5. ioctl(fd, LOAD_ISCR_REG, reg);
   Loads the Interrupt Signal and Control Register.
   See pci-quad04.h.

6. ioctl(fd, GET_ISCR_REG, &reg);
   Reads the Interrupt Signal and Control Register.

7. ioctl(fd, LOAD_PIC_A_REG, &reg);
   Loads the 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller, Part A

8. ioctl(fd, LOAD_PIC_B_REG, &reg);
   Loads the 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller, Part B
