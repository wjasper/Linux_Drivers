This driver was written by Warren J. Jasper at North Carolina State
University (wjasper@ncsu.edu).  It is a driver for the
Measurement Computing PCI-CTR05 Counter Timer board.

Building and installing the driver:
-----------------------------------

1. Untar the tar file:

   tar zxvf PCI-CTR05.1.10.tgz

2. This should create the following files:

c9513.c
c9513_2_4.c
c9513_2_6.c
c9513_2_6_29.c
c9513_3_3_7.c
c9513_3_10_11.c
c9513_4_0_8.c
c9513.h
pci-ctr05.h
test-ctr05.c
License
Makefile
README
ModList

3. The default configuration is for the kernel to dynamically set the
   major number.  If you wish to override this option and force a particular
   major number, set the following in c9513.h

   #define DEFAULT_MAJOR_DEV  0    /* Default Major Device Number */

4. If you have more than one board on your system, edit
       MAX_BOARDS=1

5. To compile, type:

   make

6. Copy the file 61-mcc.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d,
   (or 60-mcc.rules for the older 2.6 kernel).  

   or inlcude the following rules:

#Enable non-root access to pci devices
SUBSYSTEM=="ctr05",      KERNEL=="ctr[0-9]_*",    NAME="ctr05/%k",      MODE="666"
SUBSYSTEM=="ctr05",      KERNEL=="dio[0-9]_*",    NAME="ctr05/%k",      MODE="666"

To test your updated rules you can do one of the following:
1.    /sbin/udevadm control --reload  (or something similar.  type man udevadm)
2.    Reboot your system


7. To install the driver type:

    make install

8. To test run the test program "test-ctr05":

    test-ctr05

Having the driver install at boot: (2.4 kernel only)
----------------------------------

There are 2 ways you can do this:

1) add the following line to your /etc/modules.conf

        alias char-major-242 pci-ctr05

2) To install the driver so that it comes up every time on boot-up, you
   will need to include the following lines in one of your boot rc files.
   The one we used is called /etc/rc.d/rc.local. Your setup may vary.

#! /bin/sh
#
# rc.local	This does local customization.
#
# Author:	Warren Jasper <wjasper@ncsu.edu>
#

echo -n "Local customization:"

if [ -x /sbin/insmod -a -r /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/pci-ctr05.o ]; then
        echo -n "PCI-CTR05"
        /sbin/insmod -f /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/pci-ctr05.o
fi

How the driver works:
---------------------

The driver is fairly straight forward, but since the current version of
Linux is not 1003.4 compliant (it is not a real-time operating system),
certain design decisions were made in writing this driver. 

The PCI-CTR05 is based on the AM9513.  I have two comments about the
AM9513.  First, the chip is way too complicated for its own good. Second,
the chip is no longer made by AMD, and documentation is hard to come by.
If you really want to use this driver and the chip to its fullest extent,
you need to get a copy of the manual Am9513A/Am9513 Technical Manual.  I have
included a pdf version of the document called 9513.pdf.

The driver is a straight Linux implementation based loosly on the DOS
driver for this board by ComputerBoards.  Each minor number
corresponds to a given counter.  There are five counters on the 9513,
so minor number 1 corresponds to counter 1, minor number 2 to counter 2
etc.  Minor number 0 corresponds to the 8 digital I/O bits on the
board.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| X | X | X | X | X | B2 | B1 | B0 | X | X | X | S1 | S0 | C2 | C1 | C0 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The minor number is made up as follows:

Bits 8-10 (B2-B0) comprise the board number (up to 8 boards on the PCI bus)
Bits 3-4  (S1-S0) comprise the chip select if there are multiple 9513-2 chips.
Bits 0-2  (C2-C0) comprise the counter number

The devices are made in /dev.  For example:

/dev/ctr05/ctr0_01
              ^ ^^
              | ||___________  counter number (1-5)
              | |____________  chip number    (always 0)
              |______________  board number   (0-7)


Each device starts with the name pci-ctr05_CTRXX (for the counters) or
pci-ctr05_DIOX for the DIO.  The first digit is the board number.  If
you only have one board, that number is 0.  The second number is the
counter you want to access.
 
Each channel can be opened in one of two modes:

#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

...

  int fd;
  fd = open("/dev/pci-ctr05_CTR01", Mode);

...


Where Mode is an integer and equal to:

CTR05_COUNTER   -- use the counter to count pulses on rising edge
CTR05_FREQUENCY -- use the counter to count pulses for a specified time

In order to read a count, you have to write a value to tell the
counter the input source.  Possible values are listed in pci-ctr05.h,
and are listed in the test-ctr05.c source.  For example, to read from
counter 1, input source 4 (pin 15)

int fd;
WORD buf;

fd = open("/dev/pci-ctr05_CTR01", CTR05_COUNTER);
write(fd, SRC4, 2);       /* SRC4 is a 16 bit value! */
.
.
.
read(fd, &buf, 2);       /* read 16 bit counter value */

Another write() will reset the counter.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Reading a frequency is a bit different.  Counter 5 is reserved as a
timer, while pulses are incremented on the counter N (1 - 4).  You
need to externally connect pin 31 (CTR 5 Out) to CTR N GATE (eg. pin
16 for N = 3) via the termial block or through a cable.  The input to
the counter, (ie. the frequency you are trying to measure) is through
pin 17 (Source 3 or CTR3CLK).

For example:

int fd;
WORD buf;

fd = open("/dev/pci-ctr05_CTR1", CTR05_FREQUENCY);
ioctl(fd, SET_GATE_INTERVAL, 5000);         /* 5000 = 1 second */
write(fd, SRC3, 2);                         /* SRC3 is a 16 bit value! */
.
.
.
read(fd, &value, 1);
.
.
read(fd, &value, 1);
.
.
read(fd, &value, 1);

In this case, every second a new frequency is latched in the hold
register, and the counters are reset and restarted.  To turn off the
counters, you need to close the file.

Please read the limited documentation with the board if you are not
familiar with the chip or the board.

****************************************************************************
NOTE:  You can only open one counter/timer at a time.  If you are running
multiple processes, you must make sure you close the file descriptor before
tying to open it again.
****************************************************************************

The following ioctl() functions have been implemented:
1.  ioctl(fd, LOAD_CMD_REG, arg);
    Loads the 8 bit value into the Command Register.

2.  ioctl(fd, LOAD_MASTER_MODE_REG, arg);
    Load the 16 bit value into the Master Mode Register.

3.  ioctl(fd, LOAD_ALARM_REG1, arg);
    Loads the 16 bit value into Counter 1 Alarm Register.

4.  ioctl(fd, LOAD_ALARM_REG2, arg);
    Loads the 16 bit value into Counter 2 Alarm Register.

5.  ioctl(fd, LOAD_MODE_REG, arg);
    Load the 16 bit value into the Counter Mode Register.  There are
    5 counters, each corresponding to the minor number or device that
    was opened.  For example, opening /dev/ctr05/ctr0_01 corresponds to
    counter 1.

6.  ioctl(fd, LOAD_LOAD_REG, arg);
    Load the 16 bit value into the Counter Load Register.  There are
    5 counters, each corresponding to the minor number or device that
    was opened.  For example, opening /dev/ctr05/ctr0_01 corresponds to
    counter 1.

7.  ioctl(fd, LOAD_HOLD_REG, arg);
    Load the 16 bit value into the Counter Hold Register.  There are
    5 counters, each corresponding to the minor number or device that
    was opened.  For example, opening /dev/ctr05/ctr0_01 corresponds to
    counter 1.

8.  ioctl(fd, GET_MASTER_MODE_REG, &arg);
    returns the 16 bit master mode register value.

9.  ioctl(fd, GET_COUNTER_MODE_REG, &arg);
    returns the 16 bit counter mode register value.

10.  ioctl(fd, GET_STATUS_REG, &arg);
    returns the 8 bit status register.

11. ioctl(fd, SET_GATE_INTERVAL, value);
    Sets the gateing interval, where a value is an integer
    in 1/5000 th of a second (For a 5 MHz clock frequency).  For
    example, to count the number of pulses for 1 second, set value to 5000.

12. ioctl(fd, SET_CLOCK_INPUT, value);
    Sets the clock input frequency for the 9513 Counter/Timers:
    5 MHz     value = C_5MHZ     (Default)
    1 MHz     value = C_1MHZ

13. ioctl(fd, SET_SQUARE_FREQ, frequency);
    Programs counter as a square wave with given frequency.  The output for
    channel 1 is CRT1OUT (pin 35), channel 2 is CRT2OUT (pin 34) etc.

NOTE: Many of the values for the bits are #defined in pci-ctr05.h.  Please
look over that file and the documentation before trying out the ioctl 
calls.
