       kernel 2.6     driver is called:  dio24H_2_6.c
       kernel 3.3.7   driver is called:  dio24H_3_3_7.c

       kernel 4.0.8   driver is called:  dio24H_4_0.8.c

Introduction:
-------------
This driver was written by Warren J. Jasper at North Carolina State
University.  It is a driver for the Measurement Computing PCI-DIO-24H
adapter.  

Please send comments and bug fixes to wjasper@ncsu.edu.  The source for the
driver is located at https://github.com/wjasper/Linux_Drivers

Building and installing the driver:
-----------------------------------

1. Untar the tar file:

   tar zxvf PCI-DIO24H.1.11.tgz

2. This should create the following files:
    README  
    Makefile
    dio24H.c
    dio24H_2_4.c
    dio24H_2_6.c
    dio24H_3_3_7.c
    dio24H_3_10_11.c
    dio24H_4_0_8.c
    dio24H.h
    pci-dio24H.h	
    test-dio24H.c  
    PCI-DIO24x.pdf

3. The default configuration is for the kernel to dynamically set the
   major number.  If you wish to override this option and force a particular
   major number, set the following in dio24H.h

   #define DEFAULT_MAJOR_DEV  0    /* Default Major Device Number */


  NOTE:  If interrupts are enabled, the driver will block unless the O_NONBLOCK flag is 
         used in open().  Thus, an interrupt will generate a read.

  NOTE: Only 82C55 mode 0 is available on the PCI-DIO24H, as this board emulates
          the Intel 82C55 chip.

4. To compile, type:

   make

5. To install the driver type:

    make install

    check that the destination directory is correct.

6. Copy the file 61-mcc.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d,
   (or 60-mcc.rules for the older 2.6 kernel).

   or inlcude the following rule:

#Enable non-root access to pci devices
SUBSYSTEM=="dio24H", KERNEL=="dio[0-9]_*",    NAME="dio24H/%k", MODE="666"

To test your updated rules you can do one of the following:
1.    /sbin/udevadm control --reload  (or something similar.  type man udevadm)
2.    Reboot your system

You will be able to search the attributes of the device by
   /sbin/udevadm info -a -p $(/sbin/udevadm info -q path -n /dev/dio24H/dio0_0A)



Having the driver install at boot (2.4 kernel only):
----------------------------------
There are 2 ways to do this:


1) To install the driver so that it comes up every time on boot-up, you
  will need to include the following lines in one of your boot rc files.
  The one we used is called /etc/rc.d/rc.local. Your setup may vary.

#! /bin/sh
#
# rc.local	This does local customization.
#
# Author:	Warren Jasper <wjasper@ncsu.edu>
#
echo -n "Local customization:"

if [ -x /sbin/insmod -a -r /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kenrel/drivers/char/pci-dio24H.o ]; then
        echo -n " PCI-DIO24H"
       /sbin/insmod -f /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char/pci-dio24H.o
fi


2)  add the following line to your /etc/modules.conf

        alias char-major-249 pci-dio24H


How the driver works:
---------------------

The driver is fairly straight forward, but since the current version of
Linux is not 1003.4 compliant (it is not a real-time operating system),
certain design decisions were made in writing this driver. 



When interrupts are disabled, all the read/write calls to the driver are
non-blocking.  When interrupts are enabled, all reads are blocked,
unless the O_NONBLOCK flag is set when the device is opened. writes are
never blocked.

All the devices nodes are automagically created for you by /sysfs and udev. They are

/dev/dio24H/dio[Board Number]_0[A-C]

so

/dev/dio24H/dio0_0B would be Board 0,  Port B.  Type

	ls -l /dev/dio24H

to list all the device nodes.  See the documentaion on the 8255.

****************************************************************************

The following ioctl() functions have been implemented:

1. ioctl(fd, DIO_SET_DIRECTION, PORT_INPUT);
   Set the direction of the port to either input or output.  Port C can be split
   into two levels (4 bits each), while ports A and B are either all input or
   all output.

2. ioctl(fd, INTERRUPT_ENABLE, NULL);
   Enable interrutps.

3. ioctl(fd, INTERRUPT_DISABLE, NULL);
   Disable interrutps.

4. ioctl(fd, INTERRUPT_POLARITY, polarity);
     Sets the interrupt polarity on the board
     polarity = INT_ACTIVE_LOW   interrupt active low, (default)
              = INT_ACTIVE_HIGH  interrupt active high

5. ioctl(fd, INTERRUPT_SELECT, type);
     Sets the interrupt Level/Edge Select
     type = INT_LEVEL_SENSITIVE  interrupt level sensitive
          = INT_EDGE_SENSITIVE   interrupt edge sensitive
